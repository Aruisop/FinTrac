# FinTrac
FinTrac is a fun finance tracking app, which helps you manage finances interactively.

## Need for FinTrac

The main idea behind developing this web application, was to help people track their finances effectively. With this goal in mind, we developed an application that is very humble in creation but effective in managing personal wealth.

## Features
A very robust and clean application, would love to see requests for future feature additions!

- User Authentication (Includes a signup,login pages and a logout option when on homepage).
- Expense Tracking (Using lists and graphical representations).
- A very simple user friendly finance dashboard, which tracks the number of transactions added by the user based on being either a means of an income or expenditure.
- Visualises data using a dynamic pie chart for income vs expenses.
- Session management to ensure security.

## Tech Stack
So we used the following frameworks and languages:
- Backend : PHP
- Frontend : Javascript and HTML
- Database : MySQL

## How it works in action!
As a user to work on this project, you just need to:
- Clone the repository and on cd run
  -> **git clone <theurl>**
  -> **cd fintrac**
 - For the database part, either use MYSQL directly or use a hosted environment like **XAMPP** which also helps in creating an Apache Server directly.
 - If you choose to directly work on this project without the use of any platforms, start a local PHP server using: **php -S localhost:8000**, and access the application
   via the port: **http://localhost:8000**
- While working on a hosted environment make sure to have **XAMPP** installed, and while using the control panel start the Apache and MYSQL servers, once started, on your browser type in:   **localhost/dashboard** this gets you started with the phpMyAdmin and MYSQL part. In order to see the live web app, use:  **localhost/your_file_name/page_name.php**.
